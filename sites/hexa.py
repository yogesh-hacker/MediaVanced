This scraper has been discontinued  
due to the WASM usage by the site,  
not because we lack a solution,  
but because WASM integration with Python  
is limited and not as seamless as in JavaScript.  

If you're interested, I have a working JS version  
which you can request by contacting me on Discord.

[New Update] : Hello Developers,

I have completed rewriting the code for Hexa WASM. 
However, unlike the previous version, this WASM now 
requires a browser environment.
I attempted to replicate it in Node.js, 
but providing all necessary browser APIs in Node is extremely challenging.

If you need access to it, I can share the code, 
but please note that you may require a headless
browser to create an API around it.
